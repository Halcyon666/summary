## DocSearch v2 not working in my site

### Background

My Docusaurus(version 3.1.0) blog deploy on GitHub Page, before I change my domain from 

`https://halcyon666.github.io/summary/` to `https://halcyon666.top`, the DocSearch v2 works in my site. When I apply the 

DocSearch again for my new domain, I just do the same as before doing, the search doesn't work.

### The URL Ignorance

Firstly I checked the crawler admin [https://crawler.algolia.com/](https://crawler.algolia.com/), I found many website url be ignore, because there are many 302 redirection in my new application.

I try search in the Preview Search, There is not a result about my markdown blogs except homepage informations.

you can see my correct configuration above, and the wrong configuration below, in this case solve the scrawler ignore problems.

```react
new Crawler({
  sitemaps: [],
  ignoreCanonicalTo: false,
});
```

In this time I can search in the Search Preview, but not in my site.

### The Invalid Application-ID or API key

resolve Invalid Application-ID or API key, I check the helpful [url](https://support.algolia.com/hc/en-us/articles/11217017604497-Why-am-I-getting-403-error-message-Invalid-Application-ID-or-API-key-status-403-with-DocSearch), and find my API Key is wrong, given by the DocSearch rely email, so when you encounter this error, you need check your API key in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys)


### The misunderstand faceFilters

Has result in Preview Search , but not in my site.

I get both payload from Preview Search and my site, I compare those parameters, and find that there some different with my parameters.So I checked the [docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search#contextual-search), and fix this by changing the configuration.

> This is the wrong payload Parameter in the end of the request url.
>
> `facetFilters=["language:zh",["docusaurus_tag:default","docusaurus_tag:docs-default-current"]]`
>
> and my wrong configuration is 
>
> ```ts
> contextualSearch: true,
> searchParameters: {},
> ```

You need to indicate the contextualSearch to false(*hint: this configuration in `docusaurus.config.ts` or `docusaurus.config.js`*), and write you language filter to in brackets. You can see my fixed example below.

```ts
contextualSearch: false,
searchParameters: {
  // maybe yours is en
	facetFilters: ["zh"],
},
```

### **造成失效提交Commit记录**

[添加组件`TailProtocal`](https://github.com/Halcyon666/summary/commit/7b94f431d7bfedb1e8abf6132a0688c510ffa0c2)

### **修复方案**

单独导入组件，不使用全局导入。

修复commit[记录](https://github.com/Halcyon666/summary/commit/00b6ea74b68b586919e0a2c41a67ef0037defe7b)


import TailProtocal from "@site/src/components/TailProtocal";
