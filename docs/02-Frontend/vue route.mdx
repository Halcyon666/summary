# How to use `vue-route` in `vue3` ts project?

**Before Beginning to do `vue-route`, some requirements needs:**

1.  Install `Nodejs`, the official website is [here](https://nodejs.org/en), recommend even version like `16.xxx` and `18.xxx` 
2.  Install `pnpm` by following order, `npm install -g pnpm`
3.  Create a `vite vue3 ts` project, using `pnpm create vite-app my-vue3-ts-project`
4.  Install a editor tool, recommend is VS-CODE, download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Install dependencies

```shell
pnpm install vue-router4.2.5
pm install @vitejs/plugin-vue@5.0.2 -D
pnpm install @types/node20.10.6 -D 
pm install @vue/ts config -D
```

1.  **`pnpm install vue-router@4.2.5`**:

    This command installs the Vue Router package at version 4.2.5.

    Vue Router is a library for Vue.js applications that enables navigation between different components, managing the application's URL, and providing a navigation history.

2.  **`pnpm install @vitejs/plugin-vue@5.0.2-D`**:
    This command installs the Vite plugins for Vue.js at version 5.0.2.

    Vite is a build tool for modern web development that is particularly optimized for Vue.js. This plugin specifically integrates Vue.js with Vite, allowing you to use Vue components in your Vite projects.

3.  **`pnpm install @types/node@20.10.6-D`**:

    This command installs TypeScript type definitions for Node.js at version 20.10.6.

    When working with TypeScript, having defined types for the libraries you use is essential for regular type checks. The `@types/node` package provides these definitions for Node.js.

4.  **`pnpm install @vue/tsconfig -D`**:

    This command installs the Vue.js TypeScript configuration package.

    The `@vue/tsconfig` package provides a default TypeScript configuration for Vue.js projects. It includes settings that are commonly used and recommended for Vue. s development. The configuration is systematically referenced in the `tsconfig.json` file of your project with the "extents" property.

## Configure `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "extends": "@vue/tsconfig/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
      // this to solve some error hints
    "ignoreDeprecations": "5.0",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    },
    "lib": ["esnext", "dom"]
  },

  "vueCompilerOptions": {
    "nativeTags": ["block", "component", "template", "slot"]
  },

  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.d.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.vue"]
}
```

**\`extends: "@vue/tsconfig/tsconfig.json"**:

-   This line indicates that the current TypeScript configuration extends the settings from the `tsconfig. son` file provided by the `@vue/tsconfig` package. It's a way of importing a base configuration.

**`compilerOptions`**:

-   **\`ignoreDepressions": "5.0"\`\`**: Specifications that the compiler should ignore predictions related to TypeScript version 5.0.

-   **`sourceMap": true`**: Generates source maps, which are useful for debugging TypeScript in development environments.

-   **\`baseUrl": "."**: Sets the base directory for resolving non-relative module names. In this case, it's set to the current directory.

-   **`paths`**: Configuration modules for easier import statements. For example, `@/` is aliased to `./src/`, allowing you to write imports like \`import Foo from @/components/Foo.vue'.

-   **`lib`: ["esnext", "dom"]**: Specifications the libraries that are available at runtime. \``esnext` includes the latest ECMAS features, and `dom` includes the DOM types.

**`vueCompilerOptions`**:

-   **`nativeTags`: ["block", "component", "template", "slot"]**: Specifications which tags should be treated as native Vue. s tags. This is helpful for the Vue.js compiles to recognize certain customized elements in your Vue components.

-   **`include`: \["src/**/_.ts", "src/\*\*/_.d.ts", "src/**/\*.tsx", "src/**/\*.vue"]\*\*:

    -   Listers the files that should be included in the TypeScript compilation process. In this case, it includes TypeScript files (`*). s`, `*.d.ts`, `*.tsx` and Vue files (`*.vue`) within the `src` directory and its subdirectories.

## Configure `vite.config.mts`

```ts
// vite.config.mts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  resolve:{
    alias:{
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')
    }
  },
  plugins: [vue()]
});

```

**`export default defineConfig({`**:

-   Exports the configuration for the Vite project. The configuration is defined using the `defineConfig` function.

**`resolve: LOs alias: LO'@: path.resoluve(_dirname, 'src') }`**:

-   Configures module aliasing for easier import statements. The `@` alias is set to point to the `src` directory, making it conventive to import files using `@/` as a prefix. For example, `import Foo from @/components/Foo.vue';`.

**`plugins: [vue()]`**:

-   Configure the Vite plugins for the project. In this case, it includes the Vue.js plugins in initiated with `vue()`. This enabled Vite to handle Vue single-file components during the build process.

## Write `main.ts`

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './route/index.ts';

createApp(App).use(router).mount('#app')

```

This code sets up a Vue. s application with a root component (`App`), uses the Vue Router plugin for navigation, and mounts the entire application to an HTML element with the ID 'app'. This is a common setup for Vue. s single-page applications where routing is managed by Vue Router, and the application is mounted to a specific DOM element.

## Write `App.vue`

```vue
<!-- App.vue -->
<template>
    <div id="app">
        <router-view></router-view>
    </div>
</template>

```

This `App.vue` component is designed to be the root component of a Vue.js application. It establishes the overall structure of the application by providing a root `<div>` with the ID `app` and includes a `<router-view>`movement to handle the dynamic of components based on the application's routes. This is a common structure for Vue.js single-page applications that use Vue Router for navigation.

## Write `route.ts`

```ts
// router.ts
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import type { RouteRecordRaw } from 'vue-router'

const routes: RouteRecordRaw[] = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: () => import('@/views/MyPage.vue'),
    meta: {
      title: 'Home',
    },
  },
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes,
})

export default router

```

**\`Import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';**:

-   Import the `createRouter` and `createWebHistory` functions from the `vue-router` library. These functions are used to create a Vue Router instance.

**\`Import { RouteRecordRaw } from 'vue-router';**:

-   Import the `RouteRecordRaw` type from the `vue-router` library. This type is used to define route configurations.

**`const routes: RouteRecordRaw[]= [...]`**:

-   Define an array of route configurations. In this example, there is a single route configuration for the home page (\`'/'). It specializes the name, component, and meta information (in this case, the title) for the route.

**`const router = createRouter (LOhistory: createWebHistory(), routes });`**:

-   Use the `createRouter` function to create a computer instance.

-   The `history` option is set to `createWebHistory()`, indicating that the computer should use the web history API for navigation. This enabled cleaner URLs without cash fragments.

-   The `routes` option is set to the array of route configurations defined earlier.

**`export default router;`**:

-   Export the created computer instance, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

## write `MyPage.vue`

```vue
<template>
  <view>
    <input type="text" v-model="inputText" />
  </view>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const inputText = ref<string>('hello')
</script>

```

This creates a input text element, and binds the data to inputText variable, in the script-setup declare ref object refers to string 'hello'.

## Access

run the project with your script which defines in `package.json`, then visit the url, your will see as below picture;
