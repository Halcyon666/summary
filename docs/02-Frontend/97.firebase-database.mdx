# Firebase

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up your Firebase project, complete with images and descriptions.

## 1. Setup the clientId and keys

The first step is to locate your project's configuration details, including your `clientId` and API keys. These are essential for connecting your application to Firebase services. You can find them in your project settings in the Firebase console.

In your Firebase project settings, you can find your `Web API Key` and under the "Your apps" section, you'll see the `clientId` for each app you've added.

## 2. Enable Google login

To allow users to sign in to your application using their Google accounts, you need to enable the Google sign-in provider in the Firebase Authentication settings.

## 3. Add domain to login

For security reasons, Firebase only allows sign-ins from domains that you explicitly authorize. You need to add the domain where your application is hosted to the list of authorized domains.

Still in the "Sign-in method" tab of the Authentication section, scroll down to "Authorized domains" and click "Add domain" to enter your application's domain.

## 4. Set JDK admin

To perform administrative tasks from a privileged environment (like a server), you need to use the Firebase Admin SDK. This requires a service account with the necessary permissions. You can generate a private key for this service account in the project settings.

Go back to "Project settings," select the "Service accounts" tab, and then click "Generate new private key." This will download a JSON file containing your service account credentials, which you can use to initialize the Admin SDK in your server-side code (e.g., Java, Node.js, Python).

```tsx
// 登录用户即可读写所有数据
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
