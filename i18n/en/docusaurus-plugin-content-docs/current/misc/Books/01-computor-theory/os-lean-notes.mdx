## OS Main Functions

1. OS as the interface between the user and the computer hardware system
2. OS as the manager of computer system resources
3. OS implements abstraction of computer resources

## Evolution of Operating Systems

1. Computer without Operating System
2. Single-channel Batch Processing System
3. Multi-channel Batch Processing System
   - Multi-channel, macroscopically parallel, microscopically serial.
4. Time-sharing System
   * Multi-way, independent, timely, interactive
5. Real-time System
   - Industrial control system
   - Information query system
   - Multimedia system
   - Embedded system
6. Development of Microcomputer Operating Systems
   - Single-user single-task
   - Single-user multi-task
