# Computer Network - Network Overview

## Features

Interconnection - No Master-Slave Relationship

Autonomy - Interconnectivity

Exchange Network interconnects hosts via Switching Nodes to complete data communication.

## Network Protocols

Network **Protocol**, is a rule, standard, or convention established for data exchange in progress.

**Three Elements**

Syntax: Protocol structure or format

Semantics: What control information needs to be sent, error control

Timing: Event sequence, speed matching

Authoritative Internet Protocol `RFC`

## **Network Edge** Access Core Network

Access Network Three Elements:

- Computing devices accessing the network
- Communication links
- Packet switching (Routers, Switches)

Access Network Methods:

- Residential
- Institutional Access Network
- Mobile Access Network

| Access Method | Simple Understanding | Main Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fiber Access (FTTx, e.g., FTTH Fiber To The Home)** | Fiber directly to community/building/home | Large bandwidth, low latency, many home broadband services are now FTTH |
| **Cable Modem** | Use cable TV coaxial cable to access internet | Once popular, faster than ordinary telephone lines, now gradually replaced by fiber |
| **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) Access (ADSL/VDSL)** | Phone line can also access internet (ADSL Modem) | Once common, now gradually eliminated (slow speed, poor upload) |
| **Ethernet Access** | Plug in network cable at home/company (RJ45 interface) | Highest popularity, low cost, fast speed (now generally 100M/Gigabit) |
| **LAN (Local Area Network) Access** | Internal network, school/company uses switches/routers to connect | Local internal high-speed connection, usually combined with Ethernet |

## Network Core **Interconnection**

- **Routing:** *Routing Algorithm*
- **Forwarding:** *Switch packet from router's input port to correct output port*

ISP (Internet Service Provider) Interconnection

Peering Link: Uses `BGP` protocol, **`BGP`** stands for **Border Gateway Protocol, a protocol for exchanging routing information between different Autonomous Systems (AS).**

> Peering Link is not used within the same AS
> 

Upstream Link (Transit Link)

`IXP` (Internet Exchange Point)

Large Interconnected Networks:

Tier-1 ISP (Unicom, Telecom)

Content Provider Networks (Google: Private network, its data centers connect to Internet, usually bypassing Tier-1 ISPs and regional `ISPs`)

Small operators access global network via IP Transit to access the entire Internet.

# Dynamic Switching

## Multiplexing

- `FDM` Frequency Division Multiplexing
- `TDM` Time Division Multiplexing
- `WDM` (Actually `FDM`) Wavelength Division Multiplexing
- `CDM` Code Division Multiplexing `Encoded Signal = Original Data X Chip Sequence`

1. Circuit Switching
- Establish Connection (Call/Circuit Setup)
- Communication
- Release Connection (Teardown Circuit)

Exclusive Resources (Multiplexing)

*One fiber is greater than resources needed for one phone call*

2. Message Switching

Must send the entire packet, too slow, also occupies switch memory

3. Packet Switching (Mainstream)

Allow more users to use the network simultaneously;

Store-and-forward switching mode

> Suitable for bursty data transmission networks

### `OSI` Model

 Open System Interconnection: Heterogeneous network system interconnection  

| Layer Name | Function | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Physical Layer | Interface Characteristics, Bit Verification, Data Rate, Bit Synchronization, Transmission Mode | Bit Transmission |
| Data Link Layer (Non-end-to-end) | Framing, Physical Addressing, Flow Control, Error Control, Access Control | Data transmission between adjacent network elements (hosts, switches, routers, etc.) |
| Network Layer (Non-end-to-end) | Routing, Packet Forwarding | Data packet routing and forwarding from source host to destination host |
| Transport Layer | Segmentation and Reassembly, SAP Addressing, Connection Control, Flow Control, Error Control | Ensure message submitted to correct process, e.g., port number |
| ~~Session Layer~~ | ~~Dialogue Control, Synchronization~~ | ~~Generally does not exist alone (very thin layer)~~ |
| ~~Presentation Layer~~ | ~~Data Representation Conversion, Encryption/Decryption, Compression/Decompression~~ | ~~Generally does not exist alone. Handles syntax and semantics issues of transaction information between two systems~~ |
| Application Layer | `FTP`, `SMTP`, `HTTP` | Support users using network via user agent or network interface |
