## Deep Understanding of Apache Dubbo and Practical Combat

- Chapter 3
FailbackRegistry inherits from AbstractRegistry, overrides parent class methods such as register, subscribe, query, and notify, and adds a retry mechanism. In addition, it adds four unimplemented abstract template methods.

Although each registry center has its own concrete factory class, where is it judged which factory class implementation should be called? No explicit judgment is seen in the code.<br/>
The answer lies in the RegistryFactory interface, which has a Registry getRegistry(URL url) method, and this method has the @Adaptive({"protocol"}) annotation.

Dubbo's good extensibility is inseparable from two aspects: one is that various design patterns are used appropriately for different scenarios in the entire framework, and the other is the loading mechanism introduced in this chapter.
