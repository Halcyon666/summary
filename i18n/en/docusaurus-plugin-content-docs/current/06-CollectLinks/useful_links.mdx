## Deep Understanding of Apache Dubbo and Practice

- Chapter 3
FailbackRegistry inherits from AbstractRegistry, overrides the parent class's registration, subscription, query and notification methods, and adds retry mechanisms. In addition, it also adds four unimplemented abstract template methods.

Although each registry has its own specific factory class, where is it determined which factory class implementation should be called? There is no explicit judgment seen in the code. The answer lies in the RegistryFactory interface, which has a Registry getRegistry(URL url) method with @Adaptive({"protocol"}) annotation.

Dubbo's excellent extensibility is inseparable from two aspects: first, the entire framework appropriately uses various design patterns for different scenarios, and second is the loading mechanism introduced in this chapter.
