## Configuration Commands

```shell
ssh-keygen
git config --global user.name "whalefall541"
git config --global user.email "jackchen541@sina.com"
git config --global alias.ll "log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset -%C(cyan)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%an, %cr)' --abbrev-commit"
git config --global alias.a '!git add -A && git commit -m'
```

## Configure Global .gitignore

```shell
# It's best to write absolute path here, sometimes it might not work
git config --global core.excludesfile D:/project/.gitignore 

# .gitignore can only ignore files that were not tracked originally. If some files have been included in version management, modifying .gitignore is invalid.
# The solution is to first delete the local cache (change to untracked state), then commit:

git rm -r --cached .
git add .
```

## View Commands

```shell
# View 
git log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset -%C(cyan)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%an, %cr)' --abbrev-commit
# View xxx commit content
git show <commit-id>
# View reference records
git reflog
# View file differences
git diff filename

# View differences that are added but not committed
git diff --staged
git diff --cached
# View summary statistics only
git diff --stat branch1 branch2

# View differences of a certain file between two commits. The first is the starting hash, which should be one earlier than the current view
git diff <commit> <commit> xxx.java
# View specific differences between two branches
git diff dev st 


# Diff all modified file contents at once, can also redirect to a certain file
git status | awk -F "modified:" '{if($2 != "") print $2}' | xargs git diff

# View records that are committed but not pushed
git cherry -v

# View who modified a certain line of file
git blame -L 58,100 filename
git blame -L 57,+10 filename
```

## Undo Commands

```shell
# Undo all files at once
git reset . 
git checkout .

# Undo modify status
git checkout <filename>
# Undo added files (if it's a new file it becomes untracked status, otherwise modify status)
git restore --staged test.txt
git rm --cached test.txt

# Undo add commit modify (delete commit records completely, use with caution)
git reset --hard <commit-id>
# Undo add, commit (change commit records to modify status)
git reset --mixed <commit-id>
# Only undo commit (change commit records to add status)
git reset --soft <commit-id>

# Undo one commit content
git revert <commit-id>git

# Delete all local untracked records
git clean -df
```

## Create or Delete Related Commands

```shell
# Associate local repository to remote repository
git remote add origin git@github.com:whalefall541/rebase-learn.git
# Delete association
git remote rm origin

# Delete remote branch
git push origin -d <branch-name>

# Create local branch
git branch <branch-name>
# Create and switch
git checkout -b <branch-name>
# Delete local branch
git branch -D  <branch-name>
```

## Merge Commands

```shell
# Turn off automatic merge
git merge --no-ff -m "merge with no-ff" dev

# Automatic rebase - replay another branch on current branch 
git rebase [<branch-name> | <commit-id> | <head~n>]

# Interactive rebase
git rebase -i <commit-id> <commit-id> 

`Generally use p s combination to merge multiple commits into one` 
# Note: when rebasing, commit id is left-open interval, right-closed interval;
# Be very careful that the id after rebase should be the last one, unless you don't want the commit records after that id, never do this,
# If you accidentally did it, pull from remote again

# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like "squash" but keep only the previous
#                    commit's log message, unless -C is used, in which case
#                    keep only this commit's message; -c is same as -C but
#                    opens the editor


# Rebase base branch content to current branch - rebase is moving HEAD pointer
git rebase <base-branch> <current-branch>

# rebase --onto can rebase a branch located on a sub-branch to the main branch
# Before rebase: current-upstream-branch is a sub-branch of base-branch 
# and current-branch is a sub-branch of current-upstream-branch
# After rebase: current-upstream-branch and current-branch are each sub-branches of base-branch
git rebase --onto <base-branch> <current-upstream-branch> <current-branch>

# Copy a certain commit from other branches to another branch
git cherry-pick <commit-id>
```

## Stash Content Commands

```shell
git stash
git stash list
git pop

# Stash partial files
git stash push filename

# Interactive stash files
git stash -p
```

## Commit Related Commands

```shell
echo "# 123" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
# Modify the comment pointed to by HEAD; notes: Don't amend public commits
git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message" --no-edit

git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:whalefall541/123.git
git push -u origin main

# Push directly from dev branch to all other branches, push from branch1 to branch2
git push origin refs/heads/branch1:branch2
```

## Tag Commands

```shell
# Tag on current branch current commit:
git tag v1.0

# If you want to tag on a specific historical commit:
git tag v0.9 f52c633
git tag -a <tagname> -m "<message>"

# You can view tag information with the following command:
git show v0.1

# If the tag is wrong, you can also delete it:
git tag -d v0.1

# If you want to push a certain tag to remote, use command git push origin <tagname>
git push origin v1.0
# Or, push all local tags that haven't been pushed to remote at once:
git push origin --tags    
# If the tag has been pushed to remote, deleting remote tag is more troublesome, first delete locally:
git tag -d v0.9    
# Then, delete from remote. Delete command is also push, but in the following format:
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.9
```

## Update Commands

[You can refer to this website](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/section/1138793)

```shell
# Pull all branches
git fetch --all
# Update a certain branch, if it's an aggregated project need to add --recurse-submodules=no 
git fetch origin main:main --progress --prune
 
# Rebase when pulling code - fetch and rebase 
git pull -r origin main

```
