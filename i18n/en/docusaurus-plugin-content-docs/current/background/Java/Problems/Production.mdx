# Production Problems

## Problem Handling Ideas
- Problem definition, determine whether it is internal system problem or, other system problem, or network reason
- If serious, consider rollback (or restart application) first, solve problem first, then find reason for problem
- Reason: Connection pool problem (used in thread pool), slow SQL problem, `Full GC` problem etc.


## Common Problem Handling Solutions:

- High CPU usage: Check if there are infinite loops, resource contention, etc., use performance analysis tools to locate specific code positions
- Memory leak: Through heap dump analysis, find objects occupying large memory, check if object lifecycle management is reasonable
- Database connection exception: Check connection pool configuration, network status, and if there are connections not released in time
