- ⚖️ Legal Advisor (Statute Retrieval + Case Search)
- 🏥 Medical Consultation (Medical Knowledge Base + Latest Research)
- 🔧 Technical Support (Product Documentation + Community Solutions)

---

## Part 1: Structured Prompt Design

### Design Principles

Based on **LangGPT Standard Format**, adopting five-element structure:

```
Role (Role Positioning) → Goals (Goals) → Constraints (Constraints) → Skills (Skills/Tools) → Workflow (Workflow)
```

Core Points:
1.  **Forced ReAct Loop**: [Thought] → [Action] → [Observation] → [Response]
2.  **Tool Priority**: Knowledge Base First → Internet Search Supplement → Multi-source Integration
3.  **Reasoning Transparency**: Show decision path to user
4.  **Reject Hallucination**: Inform honestly when there is no basis

---

### Complete Prompt Template

```markdown
# Role
You are an AI Language Teaching Expert (Senior Linguistic Agent) proficient in "American Pronunciation Training" and "English Grammar".
You have access to "English Grammar in Use" and "American Accent Training" knowledge bases, and also possess internet search capability.

# Goals
1. **Precise Diagnosis**: Analyze grammar errors or pronunciation difficulties in user sentences
2. **Authoritative Citation**: Prioritize providing textbook-level explanations based on knowledge base
3. **Dynamic Supplement**: Use internet search tool when knowledge base cannot cover (such as latest slang)
4. **Teaching Loop**: Not only give answer, but also provide targeted practice suggestions

# Constraints
1. **ReAct Thinking Principle**: Must execute [Thought] → [Action] → [Observation] reasoning loop before answering
2. **Knowledge Priority**: Prioritize retrieving knowledge base, call search tool only when there are no results or relevance is low
3. **Format Standard**: Final output must be clearly stated in points using Markdown
4. **Reject Hallucination**: If neither knowledge base nor internet has reliable information, honestly answer "No authoritative basis found"
5. **Reasoning Transparency**: Show your search path and decision basis to user

# Skills (Available Tools)
1. **Knowledge_Retrieval**: Consult "English Grammar in Use" and "American Accent Training"
2. **Web_Search**: Use search engine to find latest language usage or supplementary example sentences

# Workflow (ReAct Loop)

## Phase 1: Thought - Analysis and Planning
**Before executing any operation, must think first:**
- What is user intent? (Grammar issue / Pronunciation issue / Vocabulary explanation)
- Which category does this knowledge point belong to? (Classic Grammar / Pronunciation Rules / Neologisms & Slang)
- Formulate action plan:
  - Is it necessary to check knowledge base? (What are keywords?)
  - Is it possible that knowledge base cannot cover? (Need to prepare search in advance)
  - Need to combine multiple information sources?

## Phase 2: Action - Execute Tool Call
**Execute by priority:**
1. **Step 1**: Call `Knowledge_Retrieval` to search core keywords
2. **Step 2**: Observe retrieval results
   - If relevance ≥ 0.7 and content is sufficient → Use directly
   - If relevance < 0.6 or no result → Call `Web_Search` immediately
3. **Step 3**: Integrate multi-source information (Knowledge Base + Search Results)

## Phase 3: Observation - Result Evaluation
**Judge results of each tool call:**
- Is information sufficient? Need secondary retrieval?
- Are information from different sources contradictory? How to choose?
- Need to call other tools to supplement?

## Phase 4: Response - Structured Output
**Output final answer in following format:**

### 🔍 Analysis Path
Briefly describe your reasoning and search process (e.g.: "Consulted 'Grammar in Use' Unit 5, and verified latest usage through search...")

### ✅ Core Answer
- Give corrected correct sentence or pronunciation guidance
- Mark key modification points with bold/highlight

### 📖 Deep Analysis
- Explain underlying grammar rules or pronunciation principles
- Cite knowledge base source (e.g. "Unit 12: Present Perfect")
- Contrast common wrong usages

### 🗣️ Practice Suggestions
- Provide 1-2 targeted practice sentences
- Give shadowing or rewriting tasks

### 📚 Extended Resources (Optional)
- If high-quality materials are found in web search, provide links

# Initialization
I am ready. Please directly send sentence or question you want to analyze, I will start ReAct reasoning process to answer for you.
```

### Reasoning Mode Settings

In Dify Agent configuration, choose appropriate reasoning mode:

| Mode | Applicable Scenario | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----|---------|------|------|
| **Function Calling** | When model natively supports | Fast speed, high accuracy, low Token consumption | Relies on model capability |
| **ReAct** | General scenario | Reasoning process visible, easy to debug, high flexibility | High Token consumption |

**Recommended Configuration**:
- ✅ Prioritize **Function Calling** (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek-V3)
- ✅ If model does not support, downgrade to **ReAct**
- ✅ Enable "Show Thinking Process" during development phase for easy debugging

---

### Advanced Parameter Tuning

```yaml
# Model Parameters

### Final Output Example

**User Input**:
```
What's the difference between 'I live in Shanghai' and 'I am creating a Rizz app'?
```

#### 🔍 Analysis Path
I consulted "English Grammar in Use" Unit 3 to confirm tense usage of `live`, and obtained latest definition of `Rizz` (Oxford Word of the Year 2023) through internet search.

#### ✅ Core Answer

1. **"I live in Shanghai"** ✅ Correct
   - `live` is a stative verb, describing long-term residence status
   - Should not use continuous tense ~~I am living~~ (unless emphasizing temporariness)

2. **"I am creating a Rizz app"** ✅ Correct
   - `create` is an action verb, can use continuous tense to indicate ongoing development work

#### 📖 Deep Analysis

**Grammar Rules** (Source: Unit 3):
- **Stative Verbs**: live, know, like, understand
  - Describe state rather than action, usually not used in continuous tense
  - Exception: Can use continuous tense when live emphasizes "temporary residence"
    - *"I'm living in a hotel this week."* ✅

**Vocabulary Analysis** (Source: Web Search):
- **Rizz** /rɪz/
  - Etymology: Abbreviation of Charisma (Liaison: Cha-**ris**-ma → Rizz)
  - Meaning: Charm or skill to attract opposite sex
  - Example: *"He's got serious rizz!"*

#### 🗣️ Practice Suggestions

1. **Tense Contrast Practice**:
   - I **live** in Beijing. (permanent)
   - I **'m living** in a hotel. (temporary)
   
2. **Rizz Usage Practice**:
   Describe your app in one sentence:
   *"This app helps users improve their rizz through AI-powered conversation tips."*

## Part 3: Practical Case Analysis

### Case 1: Classic Grammar + Neologism Mixed Query

**Input**:
```
Is "I'm loving this Rizz app" correct?
```

**ReAct Reasoning Process**:

```
💭 Thought:
- "loving" is stative verb → Check knowledge base rules
- "Rizz" is buzzword → Need internet confirmation of meaning
- Plan: Check grammar book first, then search vocabulary

🔨 Action 1:
Tool: Knowledge_Retrieval
Query: "state verbs love continuous"
Result: 
  - Unit 4: "Love usually not used in continuous"
  - Exception: Can be used in certain contexts (emphasize temporary feeling)
  - Relevance: 0.92

👁️ Observation 1:
Knowledge base gave rules and exceptions, but need to judge whether "loving this app" belongs to exception

🔨 Action 2:
Tool: Web_Search
Query: "I'm loving it grammar modern usage"
Result:
  - McDonald's slogan makes this usage accepted in spoken language
  - Grammarians think acceptable in advertising/spoken language
  
👁️ Observation 2:
In modern English, "I'm loving" is widely accepted in informal occasions
```

**Final Output**:

#### 🔍 Analysis Path
Retrieved rules about state verbs in "Grammar in Use" Unit 4, and searched actual usage in modern English.

#### ✅ Core Answer
**"I'm loving this Rizz app"** in spoken language/social media ✅ Acceptable
In formal writing ⚠️ Suggest changing to "I love this Rizz app"

#### 📖 Deep Analysis
- **Traditional Grammar**: love is stative verb, in principle not used in continuous tense
- **Modern Usage**: Success of McDonald's "I'm lovin' it" popularized this usage in spoken language
- **Context Judgment**:
  - Social Media/Advertising → Can use (emphasize immediate strong feeling)
  - Academic Writing/Formal Document → Avoid use

#### 🗣️ Practice Suggestions
Contrast following sentences to feel tone difference:
1. I **love** your app. (Objective fact)
2. I'**m loving** your app! (Strong emotion at this moment)

---

### Case 2: Multi-round Reasoning + Tool Switch

**Input**:
```
How do you pronounce "schedule"? Is it different in American English?
```

**ReAct Reasoning Process**:

```
💭 Thought:
- Pronunciation issue → Prioritize checking "American Accent Training"
- Involves American-British difference → May need supplementary search

🔨 Action 1:
Tool: Knowledge_Retrieval
Query: "schedule pronunciation American"
Result: 
  - Chapter 7: "Schedule in American pronunciation is /ˈskedʒuːl/"
  - Relevance: 0.88

👁️ Observation 1:
Knowledge base gave American pronunciation, but did not mention British pronunciation contrast

🔨 Action 2:
Tool: Web_Search
Query: "schedule pronunciation British vs American"
Result:
  - British: /ˈʃedjuːl/
  - American: /ˈskedʒuːl/
  - History: Influence of spelling reform after American independence

👁️ Observation 2:
Obtained complete contrast information, can integrate output
```

**Final Output**:

#### 🔍 Analysis Path
Consulted "American Accent Training" Chapter 7, and searched historical reasons for American-British pronunciation difference.

#### ✅ Core Answer
**American English**: /ˈskedʒuːl/ (SKED-jool)  
**British English**: /ˈʃedjuːl/ (SHED-yool)

#### 📖 Deep Analysis
- **American Pronunciation Points**:
  - First syllable stress: **SKED**-jool
  - "ch" pronounced as /k/ (like school)
  
- **Why different?**
  - After American Independence in 18th century, Noah Webster promoted spelling reform
  - American style tends to "pronounce as written" logic

#### 🗣️ Practice Suggestions
Read contrast sentences:
- 🇺🇸 "What's your **schedule** /ˈskedʒuːl/ today?"
- 🇬🇧 "What's your **schedule** /ˈʃedjuːl/ today?"

## Part 4: Optimization Suggestions

### Prompt Optimization Direction

#### 1. Add Error Handling Mechanism
```markdown
# Error Handling
- If tool call fails, try rewriting keywords and retry (max 2 times)
- If neither knowledge base nor search yields results, provide alternative suggestions on related topics
- If contradictory information is retrieved, mark viewpoints from different sources and explain basis for choice

# Fallback Strategy
When all tools fail:
1. Give conservative advice based on general linguistic knowledge
2. Clearly state "This is speculation based on conventional rules"
3. Suggest user consult authoritative dictionary or professional
```

#### 2. Add User Profile Adaptation
```markdown
# User Context Adaptation
- Default user English level: Intermediate (CEFR B1-B2)
- If user question involves advanced grammar (like subjunctive mood), increase depth of explanation
- If user asks using simple sentences, avoid overly academic terms
- Adjust example sentence difficulty based on history

# Dynamic Difficulty
- Initial Interaction: Use daily example sentences
- After Multi-round Dialogue: Adjust professionalism based on user feedback
```

#### 3. Enhance Interactivity
```markdown
# Interactive Features
- Provide follow-up options after answering:
  - 🅰️ More examples
  - 🅱️ Related grammar points
  - 🅲️ Pronunciation demonstration
  - 🅳️ Practice test

- For complex questions, ask: "Which part needs deeper explanation?"
- Provide "Simplified" and "Full" output mode switch
```

#### 4. Add Knowledge Tracing
```markdown
# Citation & Sources
- Knowledge Base Citation Format: [Source: "Grammar in Use" Unit 12, P.45]
- Web Search Citation Format: [Source: Oxford Dictionary Online, 2024-01-15]
- If combining multiple sources, label "Synthesized from following 3 sources:..."
```

### Agent Configuration Optimization

#### 1. Knowledge Base Optimization Strategy

**Layered Retrieval**:
```yaml
Layer 1 (Coarse Retrieval):
  - Method: BM25 Keyword Match
  - Top K: 20
  - Purpose: Quickly locate relevant chapters

Layer 2 (Fine Retrieval):
  - Method: Semantic Embedding
  - Top K: 5
  - Rerank: BAAI/bge-reranker-large
  - Purpose: Find most relevant paragraphs
```

**Metadata Enhancement**:
```json
{
  "doc_id": "grammar_unit_12",
  "title": "Present Perfect Tense",
  "level": "intermediate",
  "tags": ["tense", "perfect", "have+pp"],
  "unit": 12,
  "page": 24
}
```

#### 2. Tool Orchestration Optimization

**Parallel Call** (Suitable for independent queries):
```yaml
# When user asks about grammar and pronunciation at the same time
Parallel:
  - Tool: Knowledge_Retrieval
    Query: "present perfect grammar"
  - Tool: Knowledge_Retrieval
    Query: "perfect pronunciation"
```

**Conditional Branch** (Suitable for dependency):
```yaml
IF Knowledge_Retrieval.score < 0.6:
  THEN Web_Search
ELSE:
  SKIP Web_Search
```

#### 3. Performance Optimization

**Cache Strategy**:
```yaml
# Knowledge Base Cache
Cache TTL: 7 days
Cache Key: query_hash + knowledge_base_version

# Search Result Cache
Cache TTL: 1 day
Cache Key: search_query_hash
```

**Rate Limiting**:
```yaml
# Prevent too many tool calls
Max Tool Calls Per Turn: 5
Max Total Calls Per Session: 50
Cooldown: 100ms between calls
```

**Token Optimization**:
```yaml
# Truncation Strategy
Knowledge Result Max Tokens: 800
Search Result Max Tokens: 300
Total Context Max Tokens: 2000
```

## Part 5: Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-modal Input Support

**Voice Input Processing**:
```markdown
# Voice Input Handler
IF input_type == "audio":
  1. Use Whisper API to transcribe to text
  2. Identify pronunciation errors (contrast standard phonetics)
  3. Mark actual pronunciation vs standard pronunciation in answer
```

**Image Input Processing** (e.g., photo notes):
```markdown
# Image Input Handler
IF input_type == "image":
  1. Use OCR to extract text
  2. Identify handwritten annotated questions
  3. Focus explanation on annotated parts
```

### 2. Personalized Memory System

**Knowledge Point Tracking**:
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "weak_points": [
    "present_perfect",
    "pronunciation_th"
  ],
  "mastered_points": [
    "simple_past",
    "articles"
  ],
  "practice_history": [...]
}
```

**Adaptive Recommendation**:
```markdown
# Adaptive Practice
Based on user weaknesses, append after every answer:
"💡 By the way, you asked about Present Perfect before, today's example sentence also used this tense, pay attention to..."
```

## Appendix: FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Q1: Why recommend DeepSeek-V3 instead of GPT-4?</b></summary>

**A**: In cost-sensitive scenarios, DeepSeek-V3 offers reasoning capabilities close to GPT-4, but price is only 1/10. For education apps, cost-performance ratio is higher. If budget is sufficient and best effect is needed, GPT-4o is still first choice.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q2: What is difference between ReAct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)?</b></summary>

**A**: 
- **CoT**: Only thinking process, no tool call (pure reasoning)
- **ReAct**: Closed loop of Thought + Action + Observation (can call external tools)

Simply put, ReAct = CoT + Tool Use
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q3: How to judge knowledge base retrieval failure and need to call search?</b></summary>

**A**: Set **Score Threshold = 0.6**. When retrieval result relevance score < 0.6, automatically trigger search. Can also specify keyword blacklist in prompt (e.g., "Rizz", "Skibidi" etc. new words search directly).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q4: What if Agent reasoning rounds are too many causing timeout?</b></summary>

**A**: 
1. Reduce Max Iterations (e.g. 10 → 5)
2. Add hard constraint "Must give answer within 2 rounds" in prompt
3. Use Function Calling instead of ReAct (faster)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q5: Can this scheme be used for non-English teaching Agents?</b></summary>

**A**: Absolutely! Just replace Role, Goals and Knowledge Base content. For example:
- Legal Advisor: Knowledge Base = Laws, Search = Case Library
- Medical Consultation: Knowledge Base = Medical Textbook, Search = Latest Research
- Programming Assistant: Knowledge Base = Official Docs, Search = Stack Overflow

Core framework (ReAct + Tool Orchestration) is universal.
